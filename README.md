Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning.
Objective:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones, minimizing false positives while maximizing fraud detection accuracy.

üìÇDataset:
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains transaction details such as amount, user ID, merchant information, timestamps, and other key attributes.

Project Workflow:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and addressing class imbalance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering ‚Äì Identifying key attributes that indicate fraudulent behavior.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development ‚Äì Experimenting with multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Optimization ‚Äì Using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to fine-tune performance.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis of Misclassifications ‚Äì Understanding and improving model predictions.

Expected Outcome:
A fraud detection system that provides high accuracy with minimal false positives, ensuring secure and reliable transactions.
